 - First proposed as a solution to the strong-CP problem
	 - No observed CP-violation in strong interactions, at minimum heavily suppressed (yet to measure neutron electric dipole moment)
 - Peccei and Quinn proposed a solution in 1977 using a global U(1) symmetry
	 - This promotes the CP-violating parameter to a field so it can be canceled
	 - Breaking the symmetry leads to a Goldstone boson (the axion)
	 - Long-lived, low-mass axions are a prime dark matter candidate
 - Results in modifications to Maxwellâ€™s equations

  - KSVZ Model
	-   Proposed by Kim, Shifman, Vainshtein, & Zakharov
	-   Adds vector-like fermions
	-   Only hadronic direct couplings
	-   Stronger diphoton couplings
- DFSZ Model
	-   Proposed by Dine, Fischler, Srednicki, & Zhitnitsky
	-   Adds multiple Higgs
	-   Hadronic and leptonic direct couplings
	-   Weaker diphoton couplings
- Non-thermal dark matter candidate
	- Sufficiently decoupled
