- Universe mostly not Standard Model
	- ~5% [[Standard Model]]
	- ~25% [[Dark Matter]]
	- ~70% Dark Energy

## Main motivating factors:
1. [[Galaxy Rotation Curves]]
2. [[Gravitational Lensing]]
3. [[Cosmic Microwave Background]]


## Hot vs Cold
 - Impacts structure formation
	 - Primarily "Hot" -> small scale stuctures erased, large structures form first then fragment
	 - Primarily "Cold" -> small clumps form first which accrete together to form larger strcutures
 - Relative ages (plus existence of galaxies at current time) indicate mostly cold dark matter
	 - Neutrinos are a form of hot dark matter, therefore can't be all of dark matter

## Dark Matter Requirements
 - Dark matter must be:
	 - Stable on cosmological timescales
	 - Near collisionless (electrically neutral)
	 - "Cold"/"Warm (definitely not "Hot")
 - Dark matter cannot be explained by the [[Standard Model]]
	 - Only stable uncharged particles are neutrinos (too "hot")
 - [[Press-Schechter Formalism]]
 - Decoupling with the [[Standard Model]]
	 - If there are non-negligible interactions with the SM (not guarnteed) then DM may be kinetically coupled to SM particles in the early universe

## Possible candidates:
 - [[Dark Photons]]
 - [[Axions]]
 - [[WIMPs]]
 - [[MACHOs]]
