$$ W^\pm \rightarrow W^\pm_\mu = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (W^{(1)}_\mu \mp iW_\mu^{(2)}) $$
$$ \gamma \rightarrow A_\mu = B_\mu\cos\theta_W + W_\mu^{(3)}\sin\theta_W $$
$$ Z \rightarrow Z_\mu = -B_\mu\sin\theta_W + W_\mu^{(3)}\cos\theta_W $$

 - [[Electroweak Interactions]] are mediated by bosons from  $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ theory 

 - Note that mass terms of $W^\pm$/$Z$ violate $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ symmetry
	 - Mass eigenstates not aligned with interaction eigenstates
	 - Leads to the [[Higgs Mechanism]]
		 -  Need 3 goldstone bosons + real Higgs
