## Parity Violation
 - Comes from the Laft handedness of the weak interaction 
	 - $P_L = \frac{1}{2}(1-\gamma^5)$
 - Verified in the Wu experiment
	 - $^{60}\text{Co}$ placed in magnetic field to be spin polarized
	 - $^{60}\text{Co} \rightarrow ^{60}\text{Ni}^* + e^- + \overline{\nu}_{e}$, excited $^{60}$Ni which emits two photons
		 - The two photons should be emitted perfectly isotropically assuming system is stable and acting as intended (EM force respects parity)
	 - Flip $^{60}\text{Co}$ polarization and repeat
	 - Difference in electron distribution is observed
 - Can be seen in pion decays ( $\pi^- \rightarrow l^- + \overline{\nu}_l$ )
	 - For nearly massless neutrino, helicity $\approx$ chirality
	 - Since pion is spin zero,
