## Helicity
$$ h = \frac{\vec{s}\cdot\vec{p}}{p}$$
 - Spin projected onto direction of motion
	 - Right handed if aligned
	 - Left handed if antialigned

## Chirality
 - Intrinsic handedness
	 - Same as helicity in 0 mass limit
 - Eigenstate of the parity operator
	 - This is why [[Electroweak Symmetry Breaking]] maximally violates parity and only interacts with left-handed particles
