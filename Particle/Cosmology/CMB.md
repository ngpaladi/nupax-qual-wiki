 - Cosmic Microwave Background
 - Formed at recombination
	 - Ionized hydrogen atoms recombine with electrons and become electrically neutral
	 - 400M years ago
	 - Leads to [[Large Scale Structure]]
 - No major interactions since (until it hits telescopes)
 - Mostly isotropic with some fluctuations
	 - Gives good, clear picture of early universe at recombination
	 - Oscillations in temp/density from competing radiation pressure and gravity
	 - Studies of oscillations being driven/damped yields information about dark matter
 - Model universe as photon bath + baryonic matter fluid + decoupled dark matter + dark radiation (neutrinos)
	  - No radiation pressure on dark matter
	  - Separation of effects on oscillation from baryons
	  - Model fits data well with ~5x more dark matter than normal matter
