- Sampling or Uniform Calorimeters
	- Sampling
		- Cheaper
		- Usually glass/plastic scintillator interspersed with absorber
		- Usually lead as absorber material (high $Z$)
	- Homogenous
		- Better resolution
		- See Lead Tungstate crystals for CMS
- Usually read out with [[PMTs]] (PHENIX) [[SiPMs]] ([[DarkQuest Upgrade]]) [[APDs]] ([[CMS]])
- EM Calorimeters read out by [[Pair Production]] and cascading radiation and decays to critical energy ($\mathcal{O}(10 MeV)$ for lead) 

## Radiation Length 
$$X_0 \approx 1/(4\alpha n Z^2 r_e^2 \ln[287/\sqrt{Z}]) \propto 1/Z^2$$
 - ~2 cm in iron, ~0.5 cm in lead
 - Calorimeters seek to be ~20 radiation lengths
 - Number of particles ~$2^{L/X_0}$
