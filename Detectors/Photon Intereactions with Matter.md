 - **Rayleigh scattering**: elastic scattering of light off particles much smaller than wavelength
 - **Compton scattering**: photon-electron scattering (quantum relativistic version of **Thomson Scattering**, whihc is nonrelativistic)
 - **Pair Production**: turns on at 1 MeV, becomes dominant around 10 MeV
