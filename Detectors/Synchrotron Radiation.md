 - Charged particles moving relativistically perpendicularly to a magnetic field
 - Same idea as [[Bremsstrahlung]] but emitted perpendicularly to direction of field
 - $-\Delta E \propto \gamma^4/r^2 \propto m^4/r^2$
 - Also called Magnetobremsstrahlung

## Cyclotron Radiation
 - Nonrelativistic case of synchrotron radiation
