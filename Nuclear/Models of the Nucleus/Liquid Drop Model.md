$${\displaystyle E_{\text{B}}=a_{\text{V}}A-a_{\text{S}}A^{2/3}-a_{\text{C}}{\frac {Z(Z-1)}{A^{1/3}}}-a_{\text{A}}{\frac {(N-Z)^{2}}{A}}+\delta (N,Z)}$$
 - Each term corresponds to an analog to a drop of liquid
	 - $a_V$ term is volume, since $V\sim R^3 \sim A$
	 - $a_S$ term is surface area, since $SA\sim R^2 \sim A^{2/3}$
	 - $a_C$ term is Coulomb repulsion, since $U \sim qQ/R \sim Z(Z-1)/A^{1/3}$
	 - $a_A$ term is asymmetry energy from Pauli exclusion principle
		 -  Don't want vacant lower energy levels for either protons or neutrons		  ![[Pasted image 20230507185417.png]]
	 - $\delta (N,Z)$ is pairing energy - related to spin coupling
		 - $=+\delta_0$ for even $Z$, $N$
		 - $=0$ for odd $A$
		 - $=-\delta_0$ for odd $Z$, $N$
