 - Defined as $x \equiv Q^2/(2p_2\cdot q)$

 - Lorentz-invariant quantity
 - Equivalent to fraction of proton momentum carried by "struck" quark in infinite proton momentum frame

## Bjorken Scaling
 - Since at high electron energies we only see dependence on $x$ in the [[Structure Functions]], this implies that we are scattering off point-like particles

## Callan-Gross Relation
 $$F_2(x, Q^2) = 2xF_1(x, Q^2)$$
  - Implies quarks are spin-1/2
