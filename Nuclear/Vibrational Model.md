## Breathing Mode

 - Shape of nucleaus expanding and contracting, density changing
	 - "Breathing mode"
	 - COM vibration (not of interest)
	 - Neutrons & protons osc. rel. to eachother

### Quad. & Octopole Vibrations
 - Phonons
 - Fig .......

## Giant Resonance

 - Giant resonance: excitations @10s MeV above ground state
	 - larger amplitudes and widths rel to single-particle excitatations
 - Independent of excitation probe (i.e. $\gamma$, $e^-$, $p$, $\alpha$)
 - "Isovector Dipole" $p$ & $n$ moving back and forth relative to eachother
	 - "Giant Dipole Resonance"

## Rotational Model

### Deformation
 - No compelling reason for spherical shape, deformed equilibrium states possible
 - Spherical nuclei @ closed shells
 - At closed shells all states occupied
	 - Spin projection $S_z = 0$
		 - Invariance under rotation only possible for sphere
 - Deformed shapes energetically favorable between shells
	 - Elongated along $z$ at beginning of major shell
	 - Elongated along $x$/$y$ at end of major shell
 - Stable ground state nuclei tend to be spherical
	 - large deformations in medium-heavy nuclei ($150 \leq A \leq 180$) and heavy nuclei ($220\leq A \leq 250$)
	 - Largest deformations and "super deformations" found in excited states of medium nuclei
### Quadrupole Deformations & Hill-Wheeler Variables
 - Simplest and most common nuclear deformation is quadrupole
 - Nuclear surface radius described by eq. 6.12
 - Hill-WHeeler variables $\gamma$, $\beta$ redundant in eq. 6.12
	 - Lund convention $\beta \geq 0$ & $0^\circ \leq \gamma \leq 60^\circ$ 
### Rotational Hamiltonian
 $H = \sum^3_{i=1} \frac{\hbar '}{2 I_i} \vec{J}_i^2$
  - axial symmetry ($I_2 = I_1 = I$)
  - $H = \frac{\hbar}{2I}(\vec{J}^2 - \vec{J}_z^2)+ \frac{\hbar^2}{2I_3}\vec{J}_3^2$
- Can describe rotation of nucleus in lab frame by "rotational wavefunction"
	- $| J M K \rangle_{\text{rot}}$ (Eq 6.15)
	- Group of states w/ different total angular momentum $J$ but share same $| J M K \rangle_{\text{rot}}$ from a rotational band
		- Members of rotational band share:
			- Energy
			- Static moments
			- EM transition rates
		- Example rotational band in Fig 6.10
	- 

### Quadrupole moment 
 - Rotational model can also describe static moments & transition rates b/w members of rotational band 
 - Intrinsic quadrupole moment
	 - $Q_0 = \int(3z^2-r^2)\rho (r) dV$
	 - In terms of body-fixed axis $R_{z'}$,$R_{\perp}$ : $Q_0 = \frac{4}{3} \langle \sum_{i=1}^A r_i^2 \rangle \delta$
		 - $\delta = \frac{3}{2} \frac{R^2_{z'} - R_{\perp}^2}{R^2_{z'} + R_{\perp}^2}\approx \frac{R_{z'} - R_{\perp}}{R}$ where $R$ is mean value
 - Can relate lab-frame quad moment to intrinsic quad moment using rotational model
	 - $Q_{JK}^{\text{(lab)}} = \frac{3K^2-J(J+1)}{(J+1)(2J+3)}Q_0^{\text{(body)}}$
 - Quadrupole moment measurement only really possible for ground state nuclei
 
### EM Transitions
 - rotational model, EM transitions b/w 2 members i n rot. band cna happen when $J$ changes without modifying intrinsic state 
	 - $B(EZ; J\rightarrow J-2) = \frac{15}{32\pi}e^2 Q_0^2 \frac{J(J-1)}{(2J+1)(2J-1)}$
