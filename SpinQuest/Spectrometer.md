 - FMag Beam Dump
 - KMag between TS1 and TS2 to focus leptons
 - TS1-3 include [[Drift Chambers]] and scintillator panels
			- Each of the [[Drift Chambers]] contains three sets of two planes of wires: u u', x x', v v' with the u,u'/v,v' planes having a stereo angle of $\pm14^\circ$
				- Spatial resolution of ~200-300$\mu$m
				- Drift time 100-200ns
				- TDC readout resolution 1.1ns
			- Each station contains two layers of scintillator panels oriented perpendicularly and read out by [[PMTs]]
				- Tracking station 3 has extra y layer
		- TS4 sits after iron absorber wall and includes [[Proportional Tubes]] 
			- Contains one scintillator panel
