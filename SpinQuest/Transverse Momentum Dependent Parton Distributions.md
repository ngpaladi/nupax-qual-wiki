 - **Sivers function** measures correlation of quark transverse momenta with nucleon transverse spin
 - **Boer-Mulders function** corresponds to correlation between quark spin and transverse nucleon spin
 - [[Drell-Yan]] gives better access to sea quarks 
	 - High momentum of incident proton means primary interactions will be with valence quarks for forward region (instrumented region)
