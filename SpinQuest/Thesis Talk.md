## Motivations for Dark Matter
- Universe mostly not Standard Model
	- ~5% [[Standard Model]]
	- ~25% [[Dark Matter]]
	- ~70% Dark Energy
 - Astrophysical observations have the following anomalies
	1. [[Galaxy Rotation Curves]]
	2. [[Gravitational Lensing]]
	3. [[CMB]]
 - Many theories for possible particulate makeup
	 - Heavy [[Sterile Neutrinos]]
	 - Dark portals/sectors (e.g. [[Dark Photons]])
	 - [[Axions]]/axion-like particles (ALPs)
	 - [[WIMPs]]
	 - [[MACHOs]]

## [[Dark Photons]]
 - Minimal $U(1)$ extension to the [[Standard Model]] 
 - Can act as a portal to a whole dark sector
 - Obtains Mass from [[Stueckelberg Mechanism]] or [[Higgs Mechanism]]
 - Adds Lagrangian terms: $${\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}\supset -{\frac {1}{4}}F^{\prime \mu \nu }F_{\mu \nu }^{\prime }+{\frac {1}{2}}m_{A^{\prime }}^{2}A^{\prime \mu }A_{\mu }^{\prime }+\epsilon eA^{\prime \mu }J_{\mu }^{EM} + \mathcal{L_{\chi\chi}}}$$
 - Leads to kinetic mixing with standard model photon with mixing parameter $\epsilon$
 - Decay width proportional to $\Gamma_{A' \rightarrow l^+ l^-} \propto \epsilon^2 \alpha_{EM} m_{A'}$
	 - $\tau \propto 1/(\epsilon^2 m_{A'})$
## [[SpinQuest]]
- Beam dump experiment with incident 120 GeV proton beam
	- $\sqrt{s}$ = 15.5 GeV 
- Primary physics goals:
	- Measure [[Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distributions|transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions]] of protons
		-  Use a [[Spin-Polarized Target]] of NH$_3$ or ND$_3$
			- Nitrogen provides paramagentic center for spin polarization of proton/deuteron
		- 
	- Displaced vertex dark matter search
- Tracking-focused spectrometer optimized to search for asymmetry in [[Drell-Yan]] process
	- Four tracking stations
		- TS1-3 include [[Drift Chambers]] and scintillator panels
			- Each of the [[Drift Chambers]] contains three sets of two planes of wires: u u', x x', v v' with the u,u'/v,v' planes having a stereo angle of $\pm14^\circ$
				- Spatial resolution of ~200-300$\mu$m
				- Drift time 100-200ns
				- TDC readout resolution 1.1ns
			- Each station contains two layers of scintillator panels oriented perpendicularly and read out by [[PMTs]]
				- Tracking station 3 has extra y layer
		- TS4 sits after iron absorber wall and includes [[Proportional Tubes]] 
			- Contains one scintillator panel layer

## [[DarkQuest Upgrade]]
 - Add sampling Electromagnetic [[Calorimeters]] from [[PHENIX]] before absorber wall
	 - Calorimeter uses lead-plastic scintillator'
	 - Increase electron energy resolution
	 - Brem recovery
 - Develop displaced tracking algorithm
	 - Bump hunt in mass for a certain displacement
		 - Displacement ~ $\epsilon$
 - Physics Reach:
